# weather-app

An app I created as a part of Free Code Camps challenges. This app collects and displays data from
openweather API and gives great activity recommendations based on the weather! Now you never need to 
worry about what to do.

Includes babel es2015 setup with webpack and loaders for css and scss. Webpack server with hot reloading also configured.
